# Inner-profile-method-for-friction-velocity-estimation-in-Matlab-codes

This paper presents an improved method, based on the curve fitting method, to estimate the skin friction of a boundary layer at low Reynolds numbers, Reθ ≤ 6000, with zero pressure gradient. The mean error of the proposed fitting method for the estimation of the friction velocities is less than 2%. At low Reynolds numbers, the log-law region does not exist strongly. By avoiding the data in the loglaw region, this method increases the accuracy of estimating the friction coefficient of turbulent boundary layers at low Reynolds numbers. In this method, a fitting method applies to the mean velocity profile in the inner region of the boundary layers, therefore not relying on the wake functions, which makes this method much simpler than the current fitting methods. To assess the performance of the proposed method, two data sets, the DNS data by Schlatter et al. (2010) and the experimental data by Österlund (1999), were used. It is shown that the proposed method provides a noticeably high accuracy for estimation of the friction velocities at low Reynolds numbers, Reθ ≤ 6000, with a mean error of −0.5% and a root mean square of the errors of 2% when compared with the experimental data, and a mean error of −0.1% and a root mean square error of 0.2% for the DNS data.
